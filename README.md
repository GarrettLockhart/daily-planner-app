<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project started off with some source code that I then added upon, the majority of the logic that makes it functional was written by me, I also changed the style to be more inline with modern design. I learned a lot with this project including how to use the momentjs library and using jquery DOM traversal. Bootstrap was another things i was able to take advantage of and I learned a lot about that.
